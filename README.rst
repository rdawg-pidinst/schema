Medadata Schema for the Persistent Identification of Scientific Instruments
===========================================================================

The `Research Data Alliance`_ working group `Persistent Identification
of Instruments WG`_ seeks to explore a community-driven solution for
globally unique identification of active instruments in the sciences.

This repository is used to maintain the PIDINST schema for the
metadata describing the instrument instance to be registered in the
PID infrastructure.  The current version of the schema has been
submitted to RDA for endorsement as a recommendation and is expected
to be published as version 1.0 soon.

Furthermore, the repository provides a mapping of the PIDINST schema
onto the current `DataCite Metadata Schema 4.3`_.
