Examples
========

This directory collects examples of serializations of instrument
metedata using the PIDINST schema.

Note that as of the writing, the schema itself is still work in
progress and the platform to run the PIDINST infrastructure on has not
yet been decided.  Therefore, the exact format for those
serializations is not yet defined.  So the examples here should be
taken as just this, as examples to illustratate how things may look
like in the end.
